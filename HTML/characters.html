          <h2><strong>Mae Holland</strong></h2>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3><strong>Analysis</strong></h3>
          <p>The protagonist of The Circle, Mae Holland is a bright young woman whose friend, <a href="#AA" rel = "noopener">Annie Allerton</a>, gets her a job at the Circle. 
            Over the course of the novel, Mae goes from being politely skeptical of the Circle’s policies 
            (especially its insistence on active social networking) to becoming an enthusiastic advocate for these policies. 
            Little by little, Mae comes to accept that privacy is immoral, that human beings have an obligation to socialize with millions of other human beings via the Internet, 
            and that the Circle is building a global utopia. She becomes distant from her family and old friends, 
            effectively trading a couple dozen “real people” for millions of virtual friends worldwide. 
            As Mae becomes increasingly loyal to the Circle, it becomes increasingly obvious to readers that Mae is a pawn: 
            the Circle’s executives are using her as a poster child for their company and a tool with which to manipulate the world’s population into accepting the Circle. 
            In the novel’s final pages, Mae betrays <a href="#TG" rel="noopener">Ty Gospodinov</a>—the founder of the Circle, who has come to question his company’s ethics—which signifies that she has surrendered to the Circle’s corrupt agenda.</p>

          <p>"It's not that I'm not social. I'm social enough. But the tools you guys create actually manufacture unnaturally extreme social needs. 
            No one needs the level of contact you're purveying. It improves nothing. It's not nourishing. It's like snack food. You know how they engineer this food? 
            They scientifically determine precisely how much salt and fat they need to include to keep you eating. You're not hungry, you don't need the food, 
            it does nothing for you, but you keep eating these empty calories. This is what you're pushing. Same thing. 
            Endless empty calories, but the digital-social equivalent. And you calibrate it so it's equally addictive."</p>

          <img src="https://www.postavy.cz/foto/annie-allerton-foto.jpg" alt="A picture of Annie Allerton in the movie The Circle">
          <h2><strong>Annie Allerton</strong></h2>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3><strong>Analysis</strong></h3>
          <p>Annie Allerton is a high-ranking member of the Circle (one of the so-called “Gang of 40”), but it’s never made clear what, precisely, she does. 
            Annie is an old friend of <a href = "#MH" rel="noopener">Mae Holland</a>’s, and she pulls strings to ensure that the Circle hires her. 
            For the first half of the book, Annie seems to be an enthusiastic advocate of the Circle’s culture and beliefs: 
            Annie encourages <a href = "#MH" rel="noopener">Mae</a> to post online about her experiences, and she expresses shock and anxiety when <a href = "#MH" rel="noopener">Mae</a> ignores her messages for even fifteen minutes. 
            However, in the second half of the novel, as <a href = "#MH" rel="noopener">Mae</a> becomes increasingly enamored with the Circle and its philosophy of transparency, 
            Annie becomes increasingly uneasy and stressed out. Seemingly jealous of <a href = "#MH" rel="noopener">Mae</a>’s new success, 
            Annie begins ignoring her old friend and eventually has a nervous breakdown, which places her in a coma. 
            The breakdown in Annie’s friendship with <a href = "#MH" rel="noopener">Mae</a> is one of the most tragic aspects of The Circle, 
            and the arc of their relationship is an argument that social networking pushes people further apart instead of bringing them closer together.</p>

          <h3><strong>Notable Quotes</strong></h3>
          <p>"Mae, they just got up and left. They never called 911 or anything. There's no record of it. They never reported it. 
            But the body was found the next day. The guy wasn't even homeless. 
            He was maybe a little mentally disabled but he lived with his parents and worked at a deli, washing dishes. My parents just watched him drown."
            Now Annie was choking on her tears.
            "Have you told them about this?"
            "No. I can't talk to them. They're really disgusting to me right now"</p>

          <img src="https://www.postavy.cz/foto/ty-lafitte-foto.jpg" alt="A picture of Ty Gospodinov in the movie The Circle">
          <h2><strong>Ty Gospodinov</strong></h2>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3><strong>Analysis</strong></h3>
          <p>Ty Gospodinov, an introverted computer genius, is the founder of the Circle and the creator of TruYou, 
            the online identity system at the core of the Circle’s success. 
            In creating TruYou, Ty thought that he was creating a digital utopia, 
            but he becomes uneasy with the Circle’s rapidly growing power. Although he’s one of the three “Wise Men” who run the company, 
            he is sidelined by the others after he calls for privacy protections. Throughout The Circle, 
            Ty is a mysterious character, seen only via webcam at the occasional company meeting 
            (although it’s hinted that those webcasts are not what they appear and Ty may have suffered a sinister fate). 
            At the end of the novel, it’s revealed that Ty is actually Kalden—the mysterious Circle employee who has been having an occasional affair with Mae Holland. 
            Kalden, trying to act on his ethical qualms with the Circle, enlists <a href = "#MH" rel="noopener">Mae</a> to help him undermine the Circle’s plans, 
            but <a href = "#MH" rel="noopener">Mae</a> betrays Ty to the other two Wise Men, who seemingly place Ty under arrest (or, it’s implied, have him murdered).<p>

        <section>
          <h3><strong>Notable Quotes</strong></h3>
          <p>"But there are a thousand protections to prevent all of this. It's just not possible. 
            I mean, governments will make sure—" "Governments who are transparent? Legislators who owe their reputations to the Circle? 
            Who could be ruined the moment they speak out? What do you think happened to Williamson? Remember her? 
            She threatens the Circle monopoly and, surprise, the feds find incriminating stuff on her computer. 
            You think that's a coincidence? That's about the hundredth person Stenton's done that to. 
            Mae, once the Circle's complete, that's it. And you helped complete it. This democracy thing, or Demoxie, whatever it is, 
            good god. Under the guise of having every voice heard, you create mob rule, a filterless society where secrets are crimes."</p>

          <img src="https://www.postavy.cz/foto/tom-stenton-foto.jpg" alt="A picture of Tom Stenton in the movie The Circle">
          <h2><strong>Tom Stenton</strong></h2>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3><strong>Analysis</strong></h3>
          <p>Tom Stenton is one of the Three Wise Men who run the Circle. 
            Of the three, he’s the most stereotypically corporate—aggressive, dangerously charismatic, and ethically lax. 
            Throughout the novel, Stenton seems to play a minor role in the company, at least from the perspective of <a href = "#MH" rel="noopener">Mae Holland</a> and her fellow Circle employees. 
            Only toward the end of the book does it become clear that Stenton is the most powerful of the Wise Men, and the one whose vision of ruthless, 
            totalitarian control will prove most influential. As Eggers implies, Stenton is a “shark”: he devours everything in his presence and always gets his way.</p>

          <h3><strong>Notable Quotes</strong></h3>
          <p>He couldn't get enough of the shark, its anxious circling.
            "Until next time," Stenton said finally. He nodded to Mae, and then to her watchers, 
            who were now one hundred million, many of them terrified, many more in awe and wanting more of the same.</p>

          <img src="https://www.postavy.cz/foto/eamon-bailey-foto.jpg" alt="A picture of Eamon Bailey in the movie The Circle">
          <h2><strong>Eamon Bailey</strong></h2>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3><strong>Analysis</strong></h3>
          <p>Eamon Bailey is one of the Three Wise Men who run the Circle. 
            Of the three, he is the most charismatic and—at least according to <a href="#TG" rel="noopener">Ty Gospodinov</a>—sincere. 
            Bailey is a folksy speaker, a pious Christian, and the father of a child, Gunner, who has cerebral palsy. 
            He is passionately devoted to the notion that human beings should share their experiences with one another, 
            and every Friday he makes speeches to his adoring employees about the Circle’s utopian mission to eliminate secrecy and unite the world electronically. 
            In a way, Eamon is the most dangerous of the Three Wise Men, since he seems to be the only one to sincerely believe in the ethics of total transparency 
            (<a href="#TG" rel="noopener">Ty</a> rejects transparency as totalitarian, while <a href="#TS" rel="noopener">Tom Stenton</a> welcomes it because it’s totalitarian). 
            As we see, Eamon is instrumental in persuading the employees of the Circle, including <a href="#MH" rel="noopener">Mae Holland</a>, 
            to surrender their privacy to the company, which bolsters an ideological program that threatens to engulf the entire planet.</p>

          <p>"And I would argue that any place in the world where gays are still persecuted, 
            you could instantly achieve great progress if all the gays and lesbians came out publicly at once. 
            Then whoever is persecuting them, and all those who tacitly support this persecution, 
            would realize that to persecute them would mean persecuting at least 10 percent of the population—including their sons, 
            daughters, neighbors and friends—even their own parents. It would be instantly untenable. 
            But the persecution of gays or any minority group is made uniquely possible through secrecy."</p>

          <h2><strong>Francis Garaventa</strong></h2>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3><strong>Analysis</strong></h3>
          <p>Francis Garaventa is a Circle employee who dates <a href = "#MH" rel = "noopener">Mae Holland</a> on and off for most of the book. 
            Francis could also be considered Eggers’s portrait of (or, if you prefer, his nasty caricature of) 
            the typical Bay Area “tech nerd”—even his first name suggests his symbolic connection with San Francisco. 
            Francis is a shy, awkward man. He suffers from premature ejaculations, 
            which means that he and <a href = "#MH" rel = "noopener">Mae</a> have many erotic encounters but they never have sex. 
            In spite of Francis’s awkwardness and sexual difficulties, <a href = "#MH" rel ="noopener">Mae</a> finds him to be adorable and deeply sympathetic. 
            In part, his allure has to do with his difficult childhood: more than one of Francis’s siblings were killed while he was still a child, 
            and, as a result, he is passionately working to design a program for tracking down kidnapped children. 
            Francis is, one could argue, the archetypal “shy boy” who some people find sexy—he’s quiet and awkward, 
            but his awkwardness makes him strangely alluring.</p>

          <p>"It's the worst story," Annie said. "His parents were such fuckups. I think there were like four or five kids in the family, 
            and Francis was youngest or second-youngest, and anyway the dad was in jail, and the mom was on drugs, so the kids were sent all over the place. 
            I think one went to his aunt and uncle, and his two sisters were sent to some foster home, and then they were abducted from there. 
            I guess there was some doubt if they were, you know, given or sold to the murderers." "The what?" Mae had gone limp.
            "Oh god, they were raped and kept in closets and their bodies were dropped down some kind of abandoned missile silo. 
            I mean, it was the worst story ever.”</p>

          <h2><strong>Mercer Medeiros</strong></h2>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3><strong>Analysis</strong></h3>
          <p>Mercer Medeiros, <a href  = "#MH" rel = "noopener">Mae Holland</a>’s old boyfriend, embodies the analog way of living and the last gasp of resistance to the Circle’s unethical philosophy of transparency. 
            He’s everything that Circle employees aren’t: confident, outspoken, good with his hands, overweight, poorly dressed, unkempt, 
            and committed to the importance of face-to-face contact. Mercer is the only character in the novel who offers an eloquent response to the Circle’s worldview: 
            he insists that the Circle has reduced human connection to a shadow of what it once was, trading rich and nuanced relationships 
            (which, he maintains, can only exist when people interact face-to-face) for shallow, meaningless social networking “friendships.” 
            Toward the end of the novel, as the Circle prepares to flood the entire industrialized world with cameras, Mercer writes <a href = "#MH" rel = "noopener">Mae</a> a letter insisting that he’s going to live as a hermit. 
            When <a href="#MH" rel="noopener">Mae</a> sends a fleet of drones after Mercer to harass him, he commits suicide by driving his car into a gorge. 
            He’d rather die, it’s suggested, than live in under the Circle’s totalitarian regime.</p>

          <p>Vinnie Holland, <a href ="#MH" rel = "noopener">Mae</a>’s father, 
            is a loving parent who suffers from MS and is unable to get good healthcare.

            However, Vinnie quickly becomes exasperated with the constant surveillance that the Circle demands in exchange for healthcare. 
            As the novel goes on, Vinnie becomes an increasingly minor character, reflecting <a href="#MH" rel = "noopener">Mae</a>’s alienation from her family and friends,

            This rebellion against the Circle leads to a rift between <a href="#MH" rel="noopener">Mae</a> and her mother, which eventually causes them not to speak anymore at all.</p>
